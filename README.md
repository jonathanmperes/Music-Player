# Music-Player

Welcome to the project: Music Player!

The project was developed as part of the first steps in learning iOS development, Swift, and Xcode.

## Description

The goal was to create a simple, interactive mobile app that allows you to listen to music. 

All you have to do is select a genre by clicking a button.

## UI

The app was built around simplicity, and it was organized in a single view.
